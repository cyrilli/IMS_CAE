# IMS_CAE
1D CAE for reconstructing IMS Bearing signals

This convolutional encoder decoder is adapted from the project [Image segmentation](https://github.com/arahusky/Tensorflow-Segmentation).

Purpose: After training on normal signals, reconstruction errors are used as HI.
         Maybe also use the weights to pretrain CNN
